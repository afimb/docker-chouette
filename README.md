## Prerequisites
Chouette2 is now proposed in the form of docker containers.
In order to run chouette2/docker you have to use docker-compose v1.7.1 which needs docker version 1.10 (or newer).
Only Centos 7 has been tested, but chouette/docker will work on any Linux distribution if docker 1.10 (or newer) is available.
To retrieve "Chouette" git has also to be installed.

## For Linux / Centos7
### Docker installation
Add yum docker.repo :

```
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/docker.repo <<-'EOF'
[dockerrepo]
name=Docker Repository
baseurl=https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/$releasever/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://yum.dockerproject.org/gpg
EOF
```

```
sudo yum install -y docker-engine git
```

### docker-compose installation
```
curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.7.1/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` > /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### Run docker without root permissions
If you are new to docker : so as to avoid lauching docker with sudo, docker, you'll need to add your user to the docker group (if it doesn't exist : `sudo groupadd docker`) ;
for Ubuntu the command will be
```
sudo adduser nom_utilisateur docker
```
or
```
sudo usermod -a -G docker nom_utilisateur
```
Then, restart docker

### Launch "Chouette2" at startup

#### Systemd script
You need to create chouette.service in /usr/lib/systemd/system/
```
sudo tee /usr/lib/systemd/system/chouette.service <<-'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Infra Serv
Requires=docker.service
After=docker.service
BindsTo=docker.service
Conflicts=shutdown.target reboot.target halt.target
[Service]
Restart=always
WorkingDirectory=/opt/chouette
TimeoutStartSec=0
TimeoutStopSec=30
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
ExecStop=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml stop
[Install]
WantedBy=local.target
EOF
```

Check that everything works (chouette must be installed first):
```
sudo systemctl start chouette.service
```

Enable service at boot:
```
sudo systemctl enable chouette.service
```

#### System V (init) script
TODO

## For docker-toolbox on Mac or Windows:
If your are on Mac or Windows, you must change every localhost with the ip address given by docker on startup.
You can see it by typing from the Docker QuickStart Terminal : ```docker-machine ip```

## Getting started
### Download docker-chouette
```
mkdir -p /opt/chouette && git clone https://github.com/afimb/docker-chouette.git /opt/chouette
```

or download the archive: https://github.com/afimb/docker-chouette/archive/master.zip and unzip archive into /opt/chouette

### Download the images docker
```
cd /opt/chouette
docker-compose pull
```

### Start all containers
```
cd /opt/chouette
docker-compose up
```

wait containers to be started...

then go to http://localhost:3000
also open Mailcatcher http://localhost:1080 to catch emails

## SMTP settings
If you don't want to use MailCatcher, you can use an external SMTP.
Stop all the containers first and then fill all the lines in the file docker-compose.yml with the information from your provider:
- smtp_host=smtp
- smtp_port=25
- smtp_domain=
- smtp_user_name=
- smtp_password=
- smtp_authentication=

and then start the containers with:
```
docker-compose up
```

## Detailed installation instruction for docker-toolbox on Mac or Windows (also valid for Linux):

- if you want to understand docker, read this https://docs.docker.com/windows/ 
- until Docker for Windows/Mac is released ([in beta now](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/), and only for Windows 10 and above), you'll have to [install the docker toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox), which includes docker-compose ;
- download https://github.com/afimb/docker-chouette/archive/master.zip and unzip in a local directory (ex. D:/docker-chouette)
- launch the Docker QuickStart Terminal (it is also possible to launch docker from a DOS terminal windows if you have already created a docker-machine, for more advanced users : see https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/windows/)
- if you are behind a proxy, followed the instructions of http://www.netinstructions.com/how-to-install-docker-on-windows-behind-a-prâ€¦  (from "docker-machine ssh default" to "docker-machine restart default")
- the next steps are the same in any OS (except that on linux you can use the localhost URL because docker runs natively on your OS without the need for a VM host)
- go in the directory where you have downloaded docker-chouette (i.e. where the docker-compose.yml file is), and ```docker-compose pull``` then ```docker-compose up -d``` (this will start the application in the background, you can check if processes are started with ```docker ps```)
- wait until all files are downloaded and the chouette2 is started (it may take several minutes)
- find the IP adress of your docker machine with ```docker ip```
- to access to the Chouette application, go in your browser to ```your_ip_address:3000```
- when you first sign up (create an organisation and user), you'll have to validate your account by going to mailCatcher (your_docker-machine_ip_address:1080) and click in the e-mail you'll just received (change the localhost address into your_docker-machine_ip_address)
- sign in with your Chouette user name and you can use the application
- if needed you can connect the Chouette PostgreSQL database from  PGADMIN (create a server with host: your_docker-machine_ip_address, port: 5433, user: chouette, password: chouette)
